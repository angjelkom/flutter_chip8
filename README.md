# Chip8 Emulator in Flutter

This is a simple implementation of a Chip8 Emulator in Flutter. [Chip8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) is interpreted programming language developed by [Joseph Weisbecker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8#:~:text=%2C%20developed%20by-,Joseph%20Weisbecker,-.%20It%20was%20initially) initially used on the [COSMAC VIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COSMAC_VIP) and [Telmac 1800](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telmac_1800)

The implementation should support most of the games (Chip8 Games not Super Chip8), this is only a demonstration and there are unfinished things like implementing audio, improving performance, interface and etc.
